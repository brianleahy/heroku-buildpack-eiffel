Heroku Buildpack for Eiffel
================================

A Buildpack that allows you to deploy Eiffel applications on the Heroku infrastructure.

## Status
* Working to first approximation.
* For a minimal example of use, see [the example application](https://github.com/mtravers/heroku-cl-example).
* For a more complex example, see [the WuWei demo site](http://wuwei.name/) and [source](https://github.com/mtravers/wuwei).

## Notes
* A Procfile is required for execution.  Make sure the application accepts the `$PORT` argument for HTTP routing.

## Todo
* Currently only the first target in the ecf is used to determine what application to deploy.  This needs to be parameterized.
* There is currently no accommodation for Heroku addons.

## Credits
* Heroku and their new [Buildpack-capable stack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)

## Usage
Push the app to Heroku. Learn more about [deploying to Heroku with git][deploy].

```bash
$ git push heroku master
```

Example output from a `git push`:

```bash
$ git push heroku master
